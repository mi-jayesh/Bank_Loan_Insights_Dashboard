# Bank_Loan_Analysis_Report
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into lending performance, loan status trends, and borrower characteristics. 

Business Problem :-
---
Banks need to monitor their loan portfolio's health and performance to make data-driven lending decisions. Without a clear understanding of loan applications, disbursed amounts, repayments, and risk factors, financial institutions may struggle to optimize their lending strategies. The goal of this project is to do EDA and develop a Bank Loan Report Dashboard that provides key insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayment performance, and borrower financial health. The dashboard will help stakeholders.

Objective :- 
---

* **Monitor KPIs:-** Track total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and DTI ratios over time.
* **Assess Loan Quality:-** Differentiate between "Good Loans" (Fully Paid/Current) and "Bad Loans" (Charged Off).
* **Visualize Trends:-** Analyze monthly lending activities, regional performance, loan terms, and borrower demographics.
* **Enable Data-Driven Decisions:-** Provide actionable insights to optimize lending strategies and reduce default risks.

Tableau Problem Statements :-

#### Dashboard 1: Summary
* How can we track total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments over time?
* What percentage of loans are categorized as Good Loans (Fully Paid & Current) vs. Bad Loans (Charged Off)?
* How can users analyze loans by multiple factors such as amount funded, amount received, interest rate, and debt-to-income ratio?
   
#### Dashboard 2: Overview
* How do loan applications, funding, and repayments trend over time? 
* Which states have the highest and lowest loan activity? 
* How are loans distributed based on loan term (36 vs. 60 months)? 
* Does employment length impact loan funding and repayments? 
* What are the most common loan purposes (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement)?
* How does home ownership status affect loan applications?

#### Dashboard 3: Details 
* How can we create a comprehensive loan details view for quick access to key borrower and loan information?

Key Insights :-
---
* A total of **38,576** 8,576 loans were processed. The total funded amount was $435.8M, while the total amount received was $473.1M, indicating that the bank has recovered more than it disbursed.
* **86.7%** of loans were classified as **Good Loans (Fully Paid or Current).**
* **13.8%** of loans were classified as **Bad Loans (Charged Off).**
* The total funded amount for Bad Loans was **$65.5M**, but only **$37.3M** was received back, indicating a shortfall of **$28.2M**, which poses a financial risk.
* **California** had the highest number of loan applications, followed by **Texas**, highlighting key markets for the bank's lending activities.
* The majority **(73.2%)** of loans were taken for a **36-month term**, while only **26.8%** were taken for **60 months**, indicating a preference for shorter loan durations.
* **Debt consolidation** was the most common **reason** for taking loans, with 18.2K applications. For all other loan purposes, applications remained below or around 5K, showing that borrowers primarily seek loans for consolidating existing debt.


Tools & Technologies Used :-
---
* **Excel :-** Utilized for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis **(EDA)**, including **conditional formatting, pivot tables, COUNTIFS, text-to-columns**, and other advanced functions to preprocess and analyze loan data.  
* **Tableau :-** Built an interactive dashboard using **calculated fields**, **parameters**, and **advanced visualizations** to provide insights into loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment trends.
